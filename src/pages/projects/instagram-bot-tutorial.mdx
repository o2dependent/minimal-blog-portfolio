## What was covered

In this Youtube tutorial, I covered how to make a basic Instagram bot for liking and following pages. This was entirely done to demonstrate how Puppetteer works for web automation. Instagram uses randomized class names which adds a layer of complexity when planning a project and I felt that this series demonstrated some good tactics to deal with these issues.

I primarily covered how to start up a basic Puppeteer project. We started with an overview of what method we will be using in this project and what each method and object's function was in creating an automated bot. I also covered some more advanced CSS selectors, such as attribute selectors, to get viewers started on their own projects.
