## What was used

This project used React, Nextjs, and Firebase as the base for the functionality of the application. I chose Firebase as to not have to go through setting up auth and data hosting myself. Due to the design of the application if I wanted to move from Firebase to my hosting I could just change the context functions to make requests to an API and the UI layer will not have to be edited at all.

For the styling and animation for the app, I chose to use Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. I have been experimenting with how Tailwind works with my development flow and I enjoy it for most projects. In retrospect, I don't believe that this was the best option for this project. I found myself having to create my CSS classes quite often and found the workflow to be pretty clunky. Framer motion on the other hand worked well here. There wasn't a ton that I needed to do for animations, but the ability to create exit animations easily was really quick and simple.

## Functionality

What I wanted to make is a to-do list app where you can add friends and create lists that will update live. I wanted to initially make this so my girlfriend and I could make lists for the grocery store or what we plan to do. This feature was made very quickly and didn't take long to have fully fleshed out. I still would like to add ordering list sections, but that will come later. The most difficult part was implementing messaging smoothly.

Creating a messaging app by itself isn't super difficult when working with Firebase. The problem that I had was making the messaging UX... good. I went through several iterations of the design to try and fit this feature in and I came to a design that I finally think works. The messaging isn't a direct message to one person, but a group messaging that is tied to the list that the user is added to. I found this to be more useful overall and ties into what I would like the app to function as.

## Future plans

I would like to continue working on this as a side project and implement better features and refine the overall user experience. To continue working on this I will need to revamp the styling system and clean up the code as well, which will be quite an undertaking. Using Tailwind CSS was very nice to start with but the bloated JSX class names make editing a component's styling very tedious.

The main feature that I would like to add is customizable profiles. Currently, I do not have personable profiles added, due to the request rates for each user. I've done pretty well to keep requests to a minimum, but using a NoSQL database requires a ton of requests for things like messages and todos. I've tried a few "hacky" ways of getting around querying for whole collections and could not find a flow that worked well with the app.

## Conclusion

This has been a fun project to work on. There are a few things I would change if I was tackling this project again, but I came out of it with a better understanding of what is needed for a project like this. Building something that can be used in a practical setting is very rewarding. Most of the projects that I have done don't have long-term functionality, so this has been an interesting experience.
I hope you enjoyed.
